# ED_Heisenberg_model 
A library to calculate 1D spin-systems for arbitrary S. Quantities like the entanglement-spectrum, Schmidt-decomposition are implemented.

Have a look at the tutorial. 
The DMRG_Tenpy.ipynp is a jupyter-notebook file which contains code for the DMRG calculations using the tenpy library.
